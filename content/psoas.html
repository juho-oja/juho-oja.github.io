<h2>PSOAS Studio</h2>
<p>If you're an international student or even from a different part of the
country, PSOAS is a good and affordable place to get your housing. We decided to
add their headquarters to the app as you may need to come and get your keys from
this office at some point.</p>
<p>They will let you know about their irregular opening hours by e-mail
with boring regularity. Not much more to add, really. Oh, and if you happen
to park there, be extremely careful. At least that's what the signs at the
gate lead you to believe.</p>
