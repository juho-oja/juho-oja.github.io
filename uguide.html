<h2 id="dapplication">1. The Application</h2>

<p>
This application showcases different points of interest around the city center
of Oulu. It features a fully interactive map which can display user position
if device location services are enabled.
</p>
<p>
Navigation features for the guided tour are fully functional but application
content is still very much in early access.
</p>

<h2 id="mapview">2. Map view</h2>

<p>
Map can be scrolled with the thumb on a mobile device, or with scrollbars and mouse wheel inside a
browser window. Interactive map elements open a context menu at the top left
of the window and they are as follows:
</p>

<table id="maptable">
	<tr>
		<td class="center"><img class="lsymbol" src="gfx/location_yellow.svg" alt="location symbol" /></td>
		<td>Major location with detailed description</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center"><img class="mlsymbol" src="gfx/location_bonus.svg" alt="sight symbol" /></td>
		<td>Other point of interest</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center"><img class="mwaypoint" src="gfx/waypoint.svg" alt="waypoint symbol" /></td>
		<td>Waypoint on the guided tour path</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center"><img class="mzoom" src="gfx/user_arrow.svg" alt="waypoint symbol" /></td>
		<td>User location (upper tip of the triangle)</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="center">
			<img class="mzoom" src="gfx/zoom_in.svg" alt="zoom in symbol" />
			<img class="mzoom" src="gfx/zoom_out.svg" alt="zoom out symbol" />
		</td>
		<td>Zoom in/out buttons</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>
User location on the map is updated every 4 seconds. Location and user arrow tips touch when user is at the waypoint.
</p>

</div>

<div class="pb">
<h2 id="locview">3. Location Details</h2>

<table class="loctable">
	<tr>
		<td class="loc"><img class="mzoom" src="gfx/go_back.svg" alt="location symbol" /></td>
		<td>Return to map or tour</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td class="loc"><img class="mzoom" src="gfx/menu_button.svg" alt="location symbol" /></td>
		<td>Location context menu</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="guidedtour">4. Guided Tour</h2>

<p>
Guided tour takes the user along a chain of waypoints. It is possible
to start the tour at any point of the route. If you're far away from the city,
you can get directions via Google Maps which can be launched from the context
menu of any map object.
</p>

<img class="barimg" src="uguide/navbar.png" />

<p>
Navigation bar displays bearing and distance to selected waypoint, as well as
user heading.
</p>

<img class="barimg" src="uguide/guided_bottom.png" />

<p>
Left and right arrows select the next waypoint in the chain. It is feasible to
follow the route in either direction. If waypoint is located at one of the
major locations, the red "Read More" button will appear.
</p>

<h2 id="navigationf">5. Navigation Features (GPS)</h2>

<p>
The application is able to make use of device location if enabled and permissions are granted.
User position is only handled locally and not stored or sent over the network at any point.
</p>

<img class="barimg" src="uguide/gpsinfo1.png" />
<p>
You should see this notification flash at least momentarily. It indicates that location
permission has been granted.
</p>

<p>
The application waits for up to 3 minutes to acquire location and throws an
error if it is exceeded. This is not necessarily a cause for concern, as it may
take somewhat longer for the device to find the satellites. It is a good idea
to activate device location about 5 minutes before loading the application.
You can always refresh the page to attempt for another 3 minutes.
</p>

<h3>Other Location Errors</h3>
<img class="barimg" src="uguide/loc_error1.png" />
<p>
If you see this notification, device location is likely turned off or
application has not been granted permission. If you want to use the GPS
features, verify that device location is turned on. Also, make sure that the
browser has access to user location, and you may need to give permission to the
application individually as well.
</p>

<img class="barimg" src="uguide/loc_error3.png" />
<p>
This message indicates a generic error for unknown reasons.
</p>

<img class="barimg" src="uguide/loc_error4.png" />
<p>
If you manage to ever see this message, you're probably inside a tunnel or
there's something wrong with the satellites.
